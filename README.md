# File Structure


* __/R__
  All the definitions of custom functions go here. It's generally best practice to group similar functions in the same script file so the folder isn't overflowing with files. Also important, there should be a data.R file in this folder that __thoroughly documents the data__.
  
* __/analysis__
  * __/scripts__ This is where the functions defined in /R get used to clean and analyze the data. Use good naming schemes and or number the scripts to define a specific order they should be run in.
  * __/output__ This is where all cumbersome tables, plots, or simulation output goes
  * __/reports__ Typically this is where an .Rmd file and the project report word document will be stored.
 
 * __/data-raw__ This is where the raw data that never gets touched goes. The contents of this folder should be provided by whoever manually entered the data.
 
 * __/data__ This is where the data you want users to have immediate access to after loading the package goes. Should be saved as an .rda file. Use devtools::use_data(x) to correctly save data into this folder.

 * __/man__ (stands for manual) This is where the documentation for all the functions in /R goes. The contents of this folder are automatically generated by roxygen. All functions defined in /R should have roxygen documenation.
