# File Structure


* /R
  All the definitions of custom functions goes here. It's generally best practice to group all similary functions in the same script file so the folder isn't overflowing with files.
  
 * /man (stands for manual) This is where the function documentation goes. The contents of this folder are automatically generated by roxygen. All functions defined in /R should have roxygen commentation that desribes what they do and how they are used.
