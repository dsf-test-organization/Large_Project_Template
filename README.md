# File Structure


* /R
  All the definitions of custom functions go here. It's generally best practice to group similar functions in the same script file so the folder isn't overflowing with files. Also important, there should be a data.R file in this folder that __thoroughly documents the data__.
  
 * /man (stands for manual) This is where the function documentation goes. The contents of this folder are automatically generated by roxygen. All functions defined in /R should have roxygen commentation that desribes what they do and how they are used.
 
 * /inst/extdata (installation/externaldata) This is where the raw data that never gets touched goes. Everything in the inst folder jumps into the parent directory upond installation.
 
 * /data This is where the data you want users to have immediate access to after installing the package goes. Should be saved as an .rda file. Use devtools::use_data(x) to correctly save data into this folder.
